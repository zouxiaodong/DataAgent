## Introduction

**DataAgent** is an enterprise-grade intelligent data analysis Agent built on **Spring AI Alibaba Graph**. It goes beyond traditional Text-to-SQL tools, evolving into an AI-powered data analyst capable of executing **Python deep analysis** and generating **multi-dimensional chart reports**.

The system adopts a highly extensible architecture design, **fully compatible with OpenAI API specifications** for chat models and embedding models, and supports **flexible integration with any vector database**. Whether for private deployment or integration with mainstream LLM services (such as Qwen, Deepseek), it can be easily adapted to provide flexible and controllable data insight services for enterprises.

Additionally, this project natively supports **MCP (Model Context Protocol)**, enabling seamless integration as an MCP server into MCP-compatible ecosystem tools such as Claude Desktop.

## Core Features

| Feature | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Intelligent Data Analysis** | StateGraph-based Text-to-SQL conversion, supporting complex multi-table queries and multi-turn conversation intent understanding. |
| **Python Deep Analysis** | Built-in Docker/Local Python executor, automatically generating and executing Python code for statistical analysis and machine learning predictions. |
| **Intelligent Report Generation** | Analysis results are automatically summarized into HTML/Markdown reports with ECharts visualizations, WYSIWYG. |
| **Human Feedback Mechanism** | Innovative Human-in-the-loop mechanism, supporting user intervention and adjustments during the plan generation phase. |
| **RAG Retrieval Enhancement** | Integrated vector database, supporting semantic retrieval of business metadata and terminology libraries to improve SQL generation accuracy. |
| **Multi-Model Orchestration** | Built-in model registry, supporting runtime dynamic switching between different LLM and Embedding models. |
| **MCP Server** | Compliant with MCP protocol, supporting external provision of NL2SQL and agent management capabilities as a Tool Server. |
| **API Key Management** | Comprehensive API Key lifecycle management with fine-grained permission control. |
